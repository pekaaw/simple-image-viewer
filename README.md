# Simple image viewer

With only a few files we get an instant image viewer by using a script and the browser.

The `run.bat` or `run.ps1` script will generate a file called `images.js` that contains a list of all the images in the current folder.  
The script then opens `index.html` which will read `images.js` and show all the files in random order.  
Files in subfolder are included.
